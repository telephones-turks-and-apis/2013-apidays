<div class="paragraph"><p>Think about that for a moment. What mistakes are the future are we ignoring? This is the question I put
to you today. This is the challenge. Because when we can recognize future mistakes, we can avoid them.
We can, as it were, "jump ahead" or "advance an extra grade" in the school of life.</p></div>

And I&#8217;d like to encourage all of us to make Miller&#8217;s warning out watchword.

looking back into the past. Back more than 100 years ago - to the late 1800s - when the world was undergoing an incredible

<div class="paragraph"><p>At first, it&#8217;s utility was thought to be limited to a small segment of society; government officials and the rich.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, in relatively short order,  the telephone quickly became a powerful tool in the arsenal of newspaper reporters who saw it&#8217;s potential to change the speed of information around the globe. Instead of threatening the future of print media, the telephone was seen as a way to improve the quality and accuracy of information in the newspaper. Technically this started with the advent of the telegraph some thirty years before, but the intamcy and immediacy of the telephone greatly sped up the process.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea of a "network" was not entirely new. In the early 1800s we built the <em>Train Network</em>. In the mid-1800s we created the <em>Telegraph Network</em>. But the <em>Telephone Network</em> of the early 20th century was orders of magnitude more distruptive and influential.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Telephones offered the promise of "instant communication" and invoked in people&#8217;s imagination a network that was, for all intents and purposes <em>alive</em>.</p></div>

<div class="title">Slide nervousSystem</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"The time is close at hand when the scattered members of civilized communities will be as closely united, so far as instant communication is concerned, as the various members of the body now are by the nervous system." - Scientific American, 1880</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Include old copy of SA Mag?</em></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>make the SciAmer reference appear on a click</strong></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This nervous system - this network of telephones - represented a major technological advance. But it also represented
a problem; one that occurred many times through the history of innovation. All the advancement, all this achievement
depended not on sleek machinery, but on overworked humans.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Photo of early switchboard room for telephones. lots of panels, many operators (women, i assume).</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Brief side note: The first telephone operators where young boys, not women. These boys had come from the ranks of
telegraph offices but, it turned out they were seen as unreliable and troublesome.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In fact, it was in my home city of Cincinnati, OH that W. H. Eckert the head of the local telephone company fired
all the boys and hired over sixty women to staff the switchboards.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, it turns out that the marvel of the age was powered by humans dashing about plugging lines together by hand.
Each connection between two parties required human intervention. This reliance on humans was just assumed in the beginning. In fact, it was considered an essential feature of the network; a kind of safety valve. A governor on machines.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This was so much a part of the thinking on how machine worked that even in the early 1950s and 60s, as computer networks began to develop, this dependence on humans was considered so important as to be acknolwedged in the very <em>name</em> of these early systems.</p></div>

All the way back to the last half of the 18th Century - 1770 to be more exact. Near the end of the Age of Enlightenment. To the House of Hapsburg in Austria and the court of Maria Theresa.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Due to a series of military and family cirsumatancdes, Maria Theresa was Austria&#8217;s monarch at a time when it was deemed unacceptable for women to rule. Technically, she shared the throne w/ her husband Francis the I and, after this death in 1765, with her son until her death in 1780. But, in truth, it was Maria Theresa who was the power behind the House of Hapsburg for close to 40 years.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By the way, you may not recognize the name of Maria Theresa of Austria, but I bet you would recognise her youngest daughter named Maria Antonia. After she married her French suitor, she changed her name to Marie-Antoinette. Now, Marie-Antoinette is famous for several things.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, Marie Theresa entertained many skilled inventors and illusionists in her court at Schönbrunn Palace. At one of these events a rather prodigous inventor, Wolfgang von Kempelen, was in attendance. As he watched a magician name Francois Pelletier perform his tricks (most of which involved the use of magnets), he was somewhat appalled at the guillibility of those in the audience and he quickly and easily debunked Pelletier&#8217;s tricks.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It should be noted that the use of Turksih garb for the manequine was a cheeky move.

Von Kempeleon was a master showman.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All accounts of the event at Schönbrunn Palace indicate Von Kempelen&#8217;s illusion was a hit. The machine won every chess match it played with anyone who wished to challenge it - usually within 30 minutes. Those in attendance were astonished and her Highness was most impressed. After this single performance, Von Kempelen dismantled the machine and put it into storage, resisting requests for additional appearances of this "Mechanical Turk" as it was then called.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, in 1781 - ten years after he unvieled his illusion, Maria Theresa&#8217;s eldest son, Emperor Joseph II, ordered Von Kempelen to re-assemble the Turk and, after a special performance in Vienna, to embark on a tour of Europe.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>pic of Alexander Graham Bell</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the things Alexander Graham Bell insisted upon when he created his telephone is that the devices NOT be sold in pairs.
This was a problem for a number of his early backers. It made no sense to them to sell a customer a <em>single</em> telephone. They
thought "No one will buy a single telephone. They won&#8217;t have anyone to talk with!" Of course, this turned out to be another
stroke of genius from Bell. If they were sold in pairs, each time a customer wanted to call someone else, they&#8217;d need another
telephone!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, to us, having a telephone on your desk at work for every person you want to call seems silly, right? But, in fact, this "selling in pairs" is the exact model we use for Web Services.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>pic of twitter icon + API page, Facebook + API page, (more needed) until the screen is filled up</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each time we create a service (publisher), we create an API (consumer) and each time we want someone to use our service, we
get them to add another `<em>telephone</em> to thier desktop. Pretty soon our desktop looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="sidebarblock">

<div class="paragraph"><p>PC/Mac with lots of telephones, each w/ a WebService icon (twitter, etc.)_</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>And <em>that</em> is a problem we need to fix.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s important to remember that we solved this problem for <em>documents</em> back in the late 90s.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But that&#8217;s old news. We&#8217;re not in the <em>Age of documents</em> anymore and this receiver is coming up short. We need a new one
that works in the same general way with <em>all</em> the services out there, not just one, and not just the ones we know about
today. It needs to work with services that haven&#8217;t even been invented yet.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But we don&#8217;t have this yet. Instead, every time we want to add a new service, we need humans to build us a dedicated client
app and we need to install that app. In fact, it&#8217;s worse than that. Once we install the dedicated app, we have to keep installing
it over and over again. Each time a new feature is added to the service we need a new version app. It&#8217;s as if we had a telephone
on our desk at work and then, when a new feature was added, we needed to update the phone dial.</p></div>

<div class="title">Slide IndistinguishableFromMagic</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke (1917 - 2008)</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the things we learned from Von Kempelen and his chess-playing Turk illusion is that people love the mystery. They want to believe in the magic.
And we certainly have lots of "magic" around us.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>build slide of all the cool "magic" of the 21st century (cell phone, google glass, retina scan security, driverless car, micro robots, etc.)</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But it&#8217;s important that we not get caught up in the illusion. That we remember that, for now at least, quite a bit of our API Economy remains dependent on the direct laobr of thousands of unseen individuals; people "underneath the tabletop" working the levers for us in order that we can enjoy the magic.</p></div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Slide buildWorkers</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>build slide of all the human workers at Chinese iPhone factories, programmers in a room, others?)</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These are the "ghosts in the machine" - the labor that makes it all possible. And there are limits to this illusion. Like Von Kempelen&#8217;s Turk, we are, sooner or later, bound to be shown up for the charlatan&#8217;s that we are. If we want to move the API Economy to a point where it is truely scalable and sustainable, we must rid ourselves of this belief in ghosts and magic.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The telephone network was able to achieve this. As early as 1920, Panel Switches began to appear. They were mechanical; they threw
latches to complete connections.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>in 1993 The Organization for Nuclear Research (also known as CERN) announced that the World Wide Web - as designed by Tim Berners-Lee - was free for all to use. Twenty years ago this year. That&#8217;s one generation - in human terms.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But there are some who think that a "generation" should be computed differently in this digital age. Estimates of the "generation rate" of the Internet to be between five and seven years. IOW, one "human" year is equal to five "Internet year." At that rate, we&#8217;re now wrapping up our fourth generation. Four generations and we&#8217;re still dependent on the same assembly lines, manual labor, and switchboard operators we relied upon at the very start. That&#8217;s a bummer.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>not sure what to do here. Would like some image/graphic that speaks to this "Internet Years" v. "Human Years" idea.</em></p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But maybe the estimates don&#8217;t mean much here. Maybe we should stick to using the same measure as all the others. In that case, we&#8217;re only one more generation away from truly automating the Web and scaling the API Economy past the limits of human labor. Does that sound right? Do we need to wait another twenty years before we break free of manually editing each API every time it changes?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We need to design and implement services that, from day one, inter-operate. We need to create modular, plug-able, composable services and enable client applications to use these components as they wish.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And again, I have to say that the hardware world is ahead of this again. A company called <em>PhoneBloks</em> has released a design idea where the smart phone is fully customizable via a set of inter-operating parts.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Users can assemble and re-arrange the parts to optimize the smart phone for their needs. Upgrade the camera, less storage for more battery life, etc. This is do-able today.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And we can do it, too. In fact, since we work in software (not hardware) we could do it faster, cheaper, sooner. If we commit to this vision of inter-operable services based on automated generic switching instead of custom-built APIs we can solve this problem in less than 20 years. We can all have Jetpacks!</p></div>
