Talk Abstract
-------------
Is our API Economy is one big giant Mechanical Turk; a human-driven system made to look like automation? Are APIs a huge parlor trick like that employed in the late 18th century by the inventory Wolfgang von Kempelen for the intelligentsia of his patron - the Austrian court?

Using examples from the history of the first person-to-person network at the turn of the 20th century - the telephone system - weâ€™ll explore the past and future path of the 21st century API Economy. Will APIs, like telephone switching, become truly automatic? Or will service-to-service communication always require humans (programmers) to constantly code and re-code connections each time a new task is required? Is our current API Economy sustainable?
